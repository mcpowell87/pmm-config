  American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movies - 10th Anniversary Edition:
    template: { name: Chart, num: 3 }
    letterboxd_list: https://letterboxd.com/rogere/list/afi-100100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/
    summary: The American Film Institute proudly curates lists to celebrate excellence in the art form. We believe their greatest impact is to inspire personal, passionate discussions about what makes a great film and why and, also, to chart the evolution of the art form. Since its inception, American film has marginalized the diversity of voices that make our nation and its stories strong â€“ and these lists reflect that intolerable truth. AFI acknowledges its responsibility in curating these lists that has reinforced this marginality and looks forward to releasing new lists that will embrace our modern day and drive culture forward.
